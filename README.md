# An Analysis of Theater Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview

This projects compares kickstarter campaigns of different types across several countries and includes details about funding and outcomes for these campaigns.
My analysis will focus specifically on 2 areas: campaign outcomes based on their launch date and a separate analysis of campaign outcomes based on the funding goals of the project

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis
By reviewing the data presented in the original workbook, I was able to produce a chart that captures a clear snapshop of the theater campaign outcomes based on each campaign launch date. 

![Theater Outcomes Vs Campaign Launch](https://github.com/FinTechNOLA/Kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) 

This chart depicts theater campaigns over the course of a year and highlights the outcomes for campaigns based on the months in which the campaigns began. 

![Kickstart Outcomes Vs Goals](https://github.com/FinTechNOLA/Kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) 

This chart provides a breakdown of theater campaign outcomes compared fo the funding goals of each project. To consolidate the data into a useful format for observation, the goals were grouped incrementally. 

### Challenges
While I experienced no significant challenges in producing this analysis, I would imagine the use of this data to inform a future campaign may be limited due to the relevance of such historical data in light of a rapidly-changing donor profile following the global pandemic. Prior funding habits may be a poor predicator without some additional longitudinal study into how donor behavior has changed.

## Results 
### Observations
In my analysis of the campaigns based on their launch date, I noted the following trends: 

1. The most successful launch months for campaigns were in the Spring months  

2. There was a seasonal decline in all project launches that reached a nadir in the Fall. At that time, there was also a noticeable absence of canceled campaigns as well in October.

In my analysis of the campaigns based on their funding goals, I noted that a high success rate of campaigns with goals under $5000 and a steep decline in success below that target goal. 

### Data Limitations
Although these observations provide some insight that can support future potential Kickstarter launches, the data is not without limitations. For example, 
- The outcomes by launch date does not account for regional or global trends as may be reflected in a seasonal adjustment provided by more longitudinal data
- The outcomes by goal lacks descriptive data around the source type of funders (individual versus institutional) that may help explain the variance in outcomes at different funding amounts, including the spike in successful campaigns in the midrange of $25-35k after a steep decline in successes in the $5k-25k range. 
 
More data around the funding source type, including use of the # of donors data already available could help to better explain the variance and provide insight for future campaigns to explore.
