# An Analysis of Theater Kickstarter Campaigns
Overview 
This projects compares kickstarter campaigns of different types across several countries and includes details about funding and outcomes for these campaigns.
My analysis will focus specifically on 2 areas: campaign outcomes based on their launch date and a separate analysis of campaign outcomes based on the funding goals of the project
Analysis and Challenges
By reviewing the data presented in the original workbook, I was able to produce a chart that captures a clear snapshop of the theater campaign outcomes based launch date. ![Theater Outcomes Vs Campaign Launch](https://github.com/FinTechNOLA/Kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) This launch date analysis depicts theater campaigns over the course of a year and highlights the outcomes for campaigns based on the months in which the campaigns began.  ![Kickstart Outcomes Vs Goals](https://github.com/FinTechNOLA/Kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) This chart provides a breakdown of theater campaign outcomes compared fo the funding goals of each project. To consolidate the data into a useful format for observation, the goals were grouped incrementally. 
While I experienced no significant challenges in producing this analysis, I would imagine the use of this data to inform a future campaign may be limited due to the relevance of such historical data in light of a rapidly-changing donor profile following the global pandemic. Prior funding habits may be a poor predicator without some additional longitudinal study into how donor behavior has changed.
